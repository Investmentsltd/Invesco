                <h3>Guidance highlights mail handling considerations unique to the election infrastructure subsector</h3><br>
                WASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) published Election Mail Handling Procedures to Protect Against Hazardous Materials. This resource helps officials understand safe mail handling procedures and provides guidance on responding to potential hazardous materials exposure.  

Over the past two decades, U.S. government offices and employees have been the target of multiple incidents using letters containing hazardous materials, including suspicious letters mailed to election offices in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington in 2023. Since mail is a key component of both standard office operations and mail balloting across the country, this guidance document provides information for election offices on how to identify and handle potentially suspicious mail and respond to potential hazardous materials exposure while handling suspicious mail. The guide also provides specific information on how to protect against the three hazardous powders of greatest concern, fentanyl, anthrax, and ricin, in addition to more routine mail hazards. 

“CISA is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with state and local election officials who face a complex threat environment,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Today’s guidance on safe mail handling procedures will help election officials and others on the frontlines of our democracy take steps to protect themselves and their personnel from hazards sent through the mail.  We will continue to work with our partners to ensure election officials have the information and resources they need to run a safe, secure and resilient election.” 

“It is essential for the FBI to leverage force multipliers, through strong partnerships and informational campaigns, like this one, which focus on election mail handling procedures," said Susan Ferensic, Assistant Director of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate. "This guidance will further strengthen the ability of those on the frontlines to be better prepared to identify and handle suspicious mail. The FBI will continue to reinforce proactive partnerships in an effort to protect election workers.”

EAC Chairwoman Christy McCormick, Vice Chair Ben Hovland, Commissioner Donald Palmer, and Commissioner Thomas Hicks said in the following joint statement: “The safety of election workers is a top priority for the EAC, as it should be for all Americans. To ensure our elections run smoothly, election officials must be able to carry out essential tasks such as opening and receiving mail without risking their health. Due to the multiple incidents involving election offices being sent hazardous materials, we urge election workers to exercise caution when handling mail by following the guidance in this resource. We will continue to work with federal partners to support officials as they conduct fair, safe, and secure elections in 2024 and beyond.”

“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to ensuring the safe and secure delivery of Election Mail, the integrity of our elections and the protection of election offices and election officials from threatening and dangerous mail,” said Gary Barksdale, Chief Postal Inspector.  “This guidance is part of our collaborative efforts with our federal partners to raise awareness with the election community of suspicious, threatening, and dangerous mail and steps that can be taken to prepare for, and respond to, these incidents should they arise.  We encourage all election offices to implement the recommendations that are part of this guidance.”

                <h3>Reflecting on the Parkland tragedy, its lasting impacts, and work still to be done</h3><br>
                Today marks six years since 17 students and faculty senselessly lost their lives and 17 others were injured when a mass murderer entered Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida and started shooting. Since that horrific day, 124 more Americans have been killed and 331 injured on campuses across the country in 189 separate school shootings—almost 3 shootings a month since Parkland. This is simply unacceptable, and it must stop.

#NeverForget
Last month, I joined Education Secretary Cardona to not only remember, but also to walk in the shoes of those who lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building 1200. I had the privilege of talking with the parents of Alex Schachter, Gina Montalto, Luke Hoyer, Jaime Guttenberg, and Alyssa Alhadeff, beautiful students with the brightest of futures ahead of them, and Debbi Hixon, the wife of Athletic Director Chris Hixon, who gave his life rushing into the building to save hundreds of students that day. <img src="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/ckeditor_medium/public/2024-02/Secretary_Cardona_Director_Easterly_Parkland_Guided_Visitation.jpg?itok=r-pWnlT8" alt="" style="width: 50%;">

With daunting courage and grace, the families of these victims have turned one of the most devastating and traumatic experiences imaginable into action. They founded organizations, such as Stand with Parkland, Safe Schools for Alex, Make Our Schools Safe, and Orange Ribbons for Jaime and have tirelessly worked with everyone from the local school district, the district attorney, law enforcement, state and local officials, and the federal government to not only raise awareness of school safety, but also to make our schools safer. 

And while there have been notable improvements since the Parkland tragedy, the work continues. My visit reinforced my belief that every student and educator has the right to learn and teach in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from any threat of violence. CISA, in collaboration with families of the Parkland victims, took action to formalize and strengthen our commitment to school safety in the wake of the tragedy by establishing the School Safety Task Force (SSTF) in 2019, our dedicated school safety program that creates resources and products to address the most pressing issues and threats confronting K-12 communities. Through our SSTF, we manage the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse, an interagency collaboration among the Departments of Education, Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; and Justice that bring the full resources from across the federal government together to strengthen the security of our nation’s schools.

As part of our work with the Clearinghouse, we manage SchoolSafety.gov, a comprehensive repository of more than 600 federal and state resources, programs, tools, evidence-based practices, and actionable recommendations across key school safety topics. A lot of our discussion while visiting Parkland was around building cultures of safety within our schools and local communities—a key focus of the resources available on the website.

School safety is not just the job of school administrators or school resource officers. We need to be thinking about how we can truly empower and engage all members of the community in safety efforts—creating positive, safe, and trusting environments; improving school physical security measures; providing appropriate training on emergency procedures and protocols; increasing mental health supports and resources; and implementing trauma-informed approaches to the educational setting.

Being in Parkland and hearing from students and faculty who were there that day and who live with the experience day in and day out underscored how important a school culture is that empowers students to come forward if they have concerns about safety. When schools are made aware of these potential threats, they can effectively intervene with the appropriate resources and support. To help schools create these cultures, CISA partnered with the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center to develop the K-12 Bystander Reporting Toolkit. This toolkit, which was released last May, offers simple strategies and guidance K-12 schools can use to implement and enhance safety reporting programs and encourage bystander reporting.

We’ve also focused on the physical security of our nation’s schools. We’ve developed evidence-based tools that K-12 schools can use to evaluate and improve physical security. The K-12 School Security Guide Product Suite helps schools assess their unique needs and identify and prioritize actions to bolster physical security. This approach brings together different parts of school security that had traditionally been siloed to detect, delay, and respond to threats and risks so there is no single point of failure. CISA’s subject matter experts in the field – our Protective Security Advisors – are also available to help schools assess their security vulnerabilities and come up with a plan to be better prepared for emergencies.

Finally, during a roundtable after our walkthrough of the school, we talked about the impact that financial resources can have on the security posture of a school. However, the grants landscape can be difficult to navigate. To help schools locate and access the federal funding that’s available to them, SchoolSafety.gov developed the Grants Finder Tool. This tool compiles and organizes existing federal school safety-related grants in one centralized location and provides direction to help schools find the grant programs most relevant or applicable to their individual needs.

My visit to Parkland had a profound impact on me as a parent, as a public servant, and as a member of the broader school safety community; I will carry this experience and these conversations with me for the rest of my life. 

To those impacted by school violence, we honor the memories of your loved ones tragically taken too soon, and we stand in partnership with you to ensure that families and communities across our country do not have to endure this pain and loss ever again.

To the survivors and the families that lost loved ones at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School six years ago today: we remain inspired and deeply moved by your actions, and by your efforts to turn your pain into progress and purpose. We are also grateful to the dedicated state and local officials for the invaluable on-the-ground work you do on the front lines of school safety. We are honored to work side-by-side with you for a safer and more secure nation.

As I reflect on all that we’ve accomplished in the six years since the Parkland tragedy, I also recognize that we have much, much more to do. The whole of CISA is steadfast in its commitment to making K-12 schools safer and more secure each day.

                <h3>JCDC 2024 Priorities</h3><br>
                In 2021, we established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) to bring together industry and government partners with new and challenging goals: enable persistent, trusted partnerships that address the most urgent current risks, and drive long-term, proactive planning. This second goal was particularly unique; never before had the U.S. government sought to engage in joint planning with the private sector around shared cybersecurity challenges. We’ve learned a lot over the past few years as we successfully executed a series of cyber defense plans. These include securing open source software in operational technology and industrial control systems, addressing risks facing remote monitoring and management, and enhancing security and incident response for the water sector, as well as gleaning valuable lessons on how to make our planning efforts valuable for each of our partners.

Today, we’re glad to publish our 2024 Priorities. These priorities will further expand the breadth and depth of our partnership to tackle more challenging, forward-leaning cyber risks that could evolve in the future, not just the immediate risks. To be clear, JCDC in this context is not a specific team or organization; it represents the collective group of industry and government partners drawn together to drive positive change for our nation’s cybersecurity.

Our 2024 priorities are defined around three focus areas. The first focus area, Defend Against Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Operations, aligns JCDC strategic and operational efforts to counter known and suspected APT campaigns that target critical infrastructure sectors with the potential to impact National Critical Functions. The second focus area, Raise the Baseline, encompasses JCDC efforts to improve the cybersecurity posture of critical infrastructure entities to reduce the frequency and impact of cyber incidents. The third focus area, Anticipate Emerging Technology and Risks, seeks to decrease the likelihood and impact of AI-related threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure providers.

Six 2024 JCDC priorities, aligned with the three focus areas, call out specific topics for increased attention.  JCDC’s Priorities for 2024 are:

Discover and defend against malicious abuse by APT actors, particularly those backed by the PRC, on and against U.S.-based infrastructure. In 2023, we saw an increase in APT activity, particularly APT groups affiliated with the People’s Republic of China, directed towards the critical infrastructure on which Americans depend. In 2024, JCDC will work with interagency and private sector partners to strengthen the ability of critical infrastructure sector organizations to prepare for and respond to future malicious activity on their networks, including activity utilizing living off the land techniques.
Prepare for major cyber incidents. JCDC will work to elevate critical infrastructure's capacity for resiliency and capability for recovery in response to major cyber incidents. This includes supporting CISA’s work to update the National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP). As directed by the President’s 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy, CISA, in close coordination with the Office of the National Cyber Director, is gathering input from public and private sector partners to identify key changes for incorporation into the updated NCIRP. Through JCDC, CISA is working to ensure this process addresses significant changes in policy and cyber operations since the NCIRP was released and plans to publish an updated NCIRP this year.
Help provide state and local election officials with information and tools to help secure their networks and infrastructure against cyber threats as part of CISA’s broader election security efforts. JCDC will support CISA’s effort to improve the security, visibility, and resiliency of the election security ecosystem by collaborating, planning, and sharing cyber threat information withJCDC industry partners, interagency partners, SLTT entities, and vendors across the elections community.
Measurably decrease the impact of ransomware on critical infrastructure. The impacts of ransomware and data extortion have proven challenging and costly for organizations of all sizes. JCDC will leverage its resources and engage with partners to prioritize operational activities that actively defend against and disrupt ransomware campaigns in collaboration with government and non-governmental entities. We will also collaborate with technology providers to leverage Secure by Design principles to scale protection.
Make measurable progress toward a world where technology is Secure by Design. Even as we urgently work to help organizations implement the most effective cybersecurity measures, we know that scalable change requires a fundamental shift in how technology is designed, built, and maintained. We will continue to drive measurable commitments across the technology ecosystem that reduce the number of defective technology products by design and ensure that strong default settings are the norm. In 2023, CISA announced our Secure by Design Alert series to identify recurring classes of defects that can be fixed through systemic changes. In 2024 we will continue to publish these alerts, including those developed in response to other priorities, such as discovering malicious abuse by APT actors. 
Decrease risk posed by AI to critical infrastructure. In alignment and coordination with CISA’s Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence, JCDC will support CISA and DHS-led efforts to decrease the likelihood and impact of AI-related threats and vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure providers.
I am incredibly proud of this collaborative team and what we have accomplished, overcoming many obstacles to meet the demands of the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. Through JCDC, CISA looks forward to furthering this work with our partners across government and private sector to tackle some of the most significant cyber risks facing our country in 2024.

                <h3>People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Hacking of U.S. Critical Infrastructure</h3><br>
                Advisory provides details on the PRC’s efforts to conceal its hacking activity, discovery and mitigation guidance to potential victims, and encourage reporting of any suspected incident  

                WASHINGTON - The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), along with key U.S. and international government agencies published a Joint Cybersecurity Advisory today on malicious activity by a People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actor, known as Volt Typhoon, to compromise critical infrastructure and associated actions that should be urgently undertaken by all organizations.
                
                CISA and its U.S. Government partners have confirmed that this group of PRC state-sponsored cyber actors has compromised entities across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in cyberspace, including communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater, in the United States and its territories. The data and information CISA and its U.S. Government partners have gathered strongly suggest the PRC is positioning itself to launch destructive cyber-attacks that would jeopardize the physical safety of Americans and impede military readiness in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.
                
                In addition to the joint Cybersecurity Advisory, CISA and our partners also released complementary Joint Guidance to help all organizations effectively hunt for and detect the sophisticated types of techniques used by actors such as Volt Typhoon, known as “living off the land.” In recent years, the U.S. has seen a strategic shift in PRC cyber threat activity from a focus on espionage to pre-positioning for possible disruptive cyber-attacks against U.S. critical infrastructure. By using “living off the land” techniques, PRC cyber actors blend in with normal system and network activities, avoid identification by network defenses, and limit the amount of activity that is captured in common logging configurations.
                
                Detecting and mitigating “living off the land” malicious cyber activity requires a multi-faceted and comprehensive approach to discern legitimate behavior from malicious behavior and conduct behavior analytics, anomaly detection, and proactive hunting. This advisory and complementary guidance provide organizations with details on how Volt Typhoon cyber threat actors use “living off the land” techniques to abuse legitimate, native tools and processes on systems, and identifies specific details on the actors’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) using certain adversarial behavior patterns.
                
                “The PRC cyber threat is not theoretical: leveraging information from our government and industry partners, CISA teams have found and eradicated Volt Typhoon intrusions into critical infrastructure across multiple sectors. And what we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,” said CISA Director Jen Easterly. “Today’s joint advisory and guide are the result of effective, persistent operational collaboration with our industry, federal, and international partners and reflect our continued commitment to providing timely, actionable guidance to all of our stakeholders. We are at a critical juncture for our national security.

                <h3>CISA and EPA Collaborate on Water and Wastewater Sector Cyber Resources</h3><br>
                WASHINGTON – Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hosted a CISA Live event on LinkedIn, titled Boosting Water Sector Cybersecurity. The event featured CISA Deputy Director Nitin Natarajan and EPA Director of Water Infrastructure and Cyber Resilience Division David Travers, highlighting the critical importance of water sector cybersecurity.

The livestreamed event shared resources specifically developed for the Water Sector and featured the Water and Wastewater Sector Cybersecurity Toolkit, which was jointly released by CISA and EPA on January 30, 2024. This toolkit marks a crucial step in bolstering the sector’s resilience against evolving cybersecurity challenges by providing practical safeguards and solutions.

“This toolkit is a testament to the power of collaboration in enhancing our national cyber defense,” said CISA Deputy Director Nitin Natarajan. “Our work in the water sector is coordinated with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), federal partners, state and local authorities, and the members of the water sector coordinating council including owners/operators and industry organizations, among others, to defend against today’s threats and collaborate to build a more secure and resilient infrastructure for the future. We look forward to seeing a measurable reduction in risks to the water sector through the resources provided in this toolkit.” 

The Water Sector is the foundation for the nation’s health, safety, economy, and security. Yet faces significant cyber and physical risks amidst resource constraints. The toolkit was developed with the water sector and equips sector members with actionable insights to elevate their cybersecurity posture in one place.

“Cyber threats present a risk to the essential drinking water and wastewater services that people across the country rely on every day. EPA, CISA and other federal agencies are working together to support cyber security best practices," said EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Radhika Fox. "This toolkit provides easy access to resources for water utilities to enhance cyber security measures.

Key features of the Water Sector Cybersecurity Toolkit include a newly published Cybersecurity Incident Response Guide and essential services such as free cybersecurity assessment services, vulnerability scanning assessment services, technical assistance support, cybersecurity performance goals alignment, and cyber hygiene tools. This arsenal of resources emphasizes the toolkit’s value in enhancing cybersecurity readiness across the Water Sector. CISA and EPA will update the toolkit periodically to include new resources and respond to the evolving needs of the sector.

                CVE-2020-3259 Cisco ASA and FTD Information Disclosure Vulnerability
CVE-2024-21410 Microsoft Exchange Server Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. 

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.

Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.

                3. TECHNICAL DETAILS
                3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS
                Siemens reports that the following network management systems are affected:
                
                SINEC NMS: All versions prior to V2.0 SP1
                3.2 Vulnerability Overview
                3.2.1 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125
                
                A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial-of-service condition. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects.
                
                CVE-2022-4203 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.2 INADEQUATE ENCRYPTION STRENGTH CWE-326
                
                A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that has observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages, the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.
                
                CVE-2022-4304 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).
                
                3.2.3 DOUBLE FREE CWE-415
                
                The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds, then the "name_out", "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial-of-service condition. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.
                
                CVE-2022-4450 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.4 USE AFTER FREE CWE-416
                
                The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally by OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.
                
                CVE-2023-0215 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.5 NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476
                
                An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i_PKCS7(), d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial-of-service condition. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.
                
                CVE-2023-0216 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.6 NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476
                
                An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3.
                
                CVE-2023-0217 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.7 IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20
                
                There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.
                
                CVE-2023-0286 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.8 NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476
                
                A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signed-and-enveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library, but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available, the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function, which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API, most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers, or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions, however third party applications would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data.
                
                CVE-2023-0401 has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).
                
                3.2.9 OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125
                
                The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer, leading to a crash. Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption. The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped, this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service. If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a low severity one.

                Deniz Cevik from Cyberwise Turkiye and Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to Siemens.
                
                4. MITIGATIONS
                Siemens is preparing fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
                
                Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk:
                
                An administrator can restrict the file and folder path permissions post installation.
                If DOORS connector is not used in the environment, add the following in the Apache configuration to restrict unauthenticated access:
                 Require all denied </If>
                If DOORS connector is used in the environment, limit access to the doorsconnector endpoint to only the specific IP address of the DOORS instance that Polarion synchronizes its data with.
                As a general security measure, Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for industrial security and following recommendations in the product manuals.
                
                Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found on the Siemens industrial security webpage.
                
                For more information see the associated Siemens security advisory SSA-871717 in HTML and CSAF.
